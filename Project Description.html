		We intend to develop a smart wearable smart device for better communication between speech impaired and non-speech impaired community
		</p>
        <p>
        	Our System will convert sign language to Regional language(Speech)

        	This will be a system which will also fulfill educational needs of that community by enhancing communication between both. 

        	In turn it will also help in creating a better bond of understanding between communities and will also educate others about sign language.

        <p>
        	<h4>We are paying special attention about the product's having:</h4>
        	<br>
        	1.Focus on regional language conversion
        	<br>
            2.Support for continuous and discontinuous gestures and speech
            <br>
            3.Portability and wearability<br>
            4.No Language barrier, a user-friendly interactive environment, especially in discussions, conversations and presentations.

	        <h2 >Our Methodology</h2>
	        <p>	
	        	<h3>Hardware Development:</h3> using Single Board Computer Cortex A8/Zynq, motor driver, DAC, Amplifiers and DAQ for signal processing, recognition and handling 
                <h3>Software Development:</h3> adaptation (and or development) of language libraries, design and development of gesture recognition  algorithm and database, developing Real Time OS (RTOS) for fast and easy recognition and GUI for end user.
                <h3>Integration of the Co-design System:</h3> After testing Hardware and Software performance separately, the integrating design methods will be adapted in this module. Then the performance analysis with the help of profiling, benchmarking and validation will be performed which will result in efficient system ready to be tested in the field.</p>

             <h2>Likely outcomes of the proposed project</h2>
             <p>
             	
             	A wearable device to convert Sign language to regional Speech.
             	<br>
                Develop the local language APIs and digital directories
                	<br>
                Develop the Gesture database and its meanings
                	<br>
                Availability of the project deliverables and technical report online. Report and deliverables will be generated twice in a year which will provide the current status of the project.
                	<br>
                The simulation model of the proposed project will be available on the same portal and which be shared on request to desired authority. 
                	<br>
                Collected data and algorithms would be available online on request.
